Teaching computer science is my passion, and at NC State I've maintained an active teaching profile.  I continue to receive near-perfect evaluations from my students and the instructors that I teach under.  My experience includes:

* CSC 216 (Java II) Teaching Assistant: Summer 2016; I assisted students with assignments, held office hours, and graded assignments.

* CSC 326 (Software Engineering) Teaching Assistant: Fall 2016 through Fall 2019: Assisting students as above; additionally, teaching labs twice a week.  I wrote and maintain the course project (see [research](/research.html) for more information) and write most homework assignments.  I teach lecture as necessary to fill gaps in instructor schedules.  I've won NC State's "Outstanding Teaching Assistant" award twice for my performance in this class.

* CSC 246 (Operating Systems Principles) Instructor: Summer 2018: I taught Operating Systems, overseeing a TA who helped with grading.  I developed lecture content, delivered lectures, wrote exams and homework assignment, and assisted students one-on-one.

* CSC 216 (Java II) Instructor: Summer 2019.  I taught Java II, writing and delivering lectures, maintaining course materials, managing our continuous integration environment, overseeing TAs, and grading assignments.  I assisted students online and in person for our on-campus and distance education sections of the course.

* CSC 326 (Software Engineering) Co-Instructor: Fall 2019.  Working with Dr. Sarah Heckman, I co-instruct Software Engineering.  I write and deliver lectures for a large course, write homework assignments, assist students, and manage our continouous integration environment.
