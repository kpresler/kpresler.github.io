## Teaching at Bowdoin College:

### Fall 2022

* CSCI 1103 (Programming with Data): A Python-based accelerated introduction to computer science, teaching students about the fundamentals of computer science, and how to use computers to analyse data.

* CSCI 2335 (Software Engineering): A new course, serving as a Java-based introduction to software engineering.  Covers the practises and processes of professional software engineering, and how we can deliver high-quality software, every single time.



## Prior teaching experience during grad school at NC State:

* CSC 216 (Software Development Fundamentals) Teaching Assistant: Summer 2016; I assisted students with assignments, held office hours, and graded assignments.

* CSC 326 (Software Engineering) Teaching Assistant: Fall 2016 to Fall 2021: Assisting students as above; additionally, teaching labs twice a week.  I wrote and maintain the course project (see [research](/research.html) for more information) and write most homework assignments.  I teach lecture as necessary to fill gaps in instructor schedules.  I've won NC State's "Outstanding Teaching Assistant" award twice for my performance in this class.  I managed the Jenkins Continuous Integration infrastructure used for six semesters before handling a transition to Github Actions in Summer 2021.

* CSC 246 (Operating Systems Principles) Instructor: Summer 2018: I taught Operating Systems, overseeing a TA who helped with grading.  I developed lecture content, delivered lectures, wrote exams and homework assignment, and assisted students one-on-one.

* CSC 216 (Software Development Fundamentals) Instructor: Summer 2019, Summer 2020, Summer 2021.  I taught Software Development Fundamentals, writing and delivering lectures, maintaining course materials, managing our continuous integration environment, overseeing TAs, and grading assignments.  I assisted students online and in person for our on-campus and distance education sections of the course.  For Summer 2020, I modified the class for online delivery and delivered the course in a synchronous online format.  For Summer 2021, I caught the class in a hybrid fashion, with some students attending live in person, some live via Zoom, and some watching recorded lectures on their own schedule.

* CSC 326 (Software Engineering) Co-Instructor: Fall 2019.  Working with Dr. Sarah Heckman, I co-instructed Software Engineering in Fall 2019.  I wrote and delivered lectures for a large course, wrote homework assignments, assisted students, and managed our continouous integration environment.
