I am the designer and lead maintainer of iTrust2, a Java EE medical records application we use as our primary teaching tool for NC State's undergraduate software engineering course, [CSC 326](https://pages.github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/326-course-page/) (NCSU login required).  The latest version of iTrust2 lives [here](https://github.com/ncsu-csc326/iTrust2).
