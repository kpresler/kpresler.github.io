I am the designer and lead maintainer of iTrust2, a Java EE medical records application we use as our primary teaching tool for NC State's undergraduate software engineering course, [CSC 326](https://pages.github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/326-course-page/) (NCSU login required).  The latest version of iTrust2 lives [here](https://github.com/ncsu-csc326/iTrust2).

I wrote a basic Java-based ORM that handles automatically converting between Java objects and persisted records in a relational database.  It exists [here](https://github.ncsu.edu/kpresle/csc540project)  (NCSU login required).

I am also responsible for [AutoVCS](https://github.com/AutoVCS/AutoVCS), an application which uses program analysis techniques to present summaries of individual developers' contributions to team-based projects.   We envision that this may be particularly helpful for helping TAs and instructors grade student projects.
