My research interests lie within computer science education and software engineering.  My current work is in semantic code search, where I am writing a tool that will let users search for SQL by providing examples of a transformation that they wish to achieve.

I am working with Gina R. Bai on a project assessing the persistence intentions of undergraduate students when exposed to different types of JUnit testcases.

I am also collaboring with Dr. Sarah Heckman, Dr. Yan Shen, and Dr. Christopher Parnin documenting our recent redesign of CSC 326 and the impact that it has had upon students.
