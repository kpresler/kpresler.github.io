My research interests lie within computer science education and software engineering.  My current work is in automated program repair, where I am writing a tool that will let users repair SQL queries by providing examples of the transformation they wish to achieve.  I am also working on understanding student interactions on software teams, the characteristics of successful teams, and how we can help teams work more productively.

I am working with Gina R. Bai on a project assessing the persistence intentions of undergraduate students when exposed to different types of JUnit testcases.
