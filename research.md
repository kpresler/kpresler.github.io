My research interests lie within computer science education and software engineering.  I am currently working on a tool that can analyse Java projects to understand the types of changes made, and summarise contributions made by individual developers.

I have recently studied using a weekly collaboration reflection survey for detecting and acting upon team-related issues in software engineering courses [1].  Prior to this, I have work in automated program repair [3], automated testing [4], and teamwork analysis [5].  I have also recently published a plan for my research trajectory at the ICER Doctoral Consortium [2].

I am working with Gina R. Bai on a project assessing the persistence intentions of undergraduate students when exposed to different types of JUnit testcases.
