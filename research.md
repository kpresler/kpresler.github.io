My current research interests continue focus on supporting teaming in computer science education.  I am studying an intervention to help software engineering students collaborate more effectively, and studying whether automated program analysis can help TAs provide students with more meaningful feedback on their contributions to collaborative projects.

I have recently studied using a weekly collaboration reflection survey for detecting and acting upon team-related issues in software engineering courses [4], with a followup work to understand how to better assist students [1].  Prior to this, I have work in automated program repair [6], automated testing [7], and teamwork analysis [8].  I have also recently published a plan for my research trajectory at the ICER Doctoral Consortium [4].

I have done work with Gina R. Bai in teaching software testing to undergraduate computer science students [2][3].
